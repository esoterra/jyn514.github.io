excerpt: On the Falcon Heavy test launch
---

As of today, February 6th 2018, from around 3:50 PM, there is a
[Tesla Roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk%27s_Tesla_Roadster)
headed to Mars.

Today marked the first successful launch of the SpaceX
[Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy), a rocket ship than
can carry other rocket ships.
Not only did the Heavy, which can carry more payload
than any other ship besides the Saturn V, launch successfully,
but its rocket boosters *then deattached and landed themselves*, successfully,
so that they can be reused for the next launch.

The car is currently in geostationary orbit within the
[Van Allen radiation belt][radiation belt], testing radiation shielding
for ["Air Force intel missions"][arstechnica].
It has [*live* coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBr2kKAHN6M)
and will launch for Mars within the next 8 hours.

To reiterate:

**THERE IS A CAR IN SPACE.**

That is all.
